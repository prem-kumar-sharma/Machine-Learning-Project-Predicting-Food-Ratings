# Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-Food-Ratings
In this project, we aim to predict the ratings of food recipes based on various features such as user comments, user ratings, and other relevant data. The dataset used includes multiple CSV files containing information on recipes, user comments, ratings, and more.
Machine Learning Project: Predicting Food Ratings
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project developed on Kaggle Colab. The goal of the project is to predict food ratings using various machine learning techniques.

Project Description
In this project, we aim to predict the ratings of food recipes based on various features such as user comments, user ratings, and other relevant data. The dataset used includes multiple CSV files containing information on recipes, user comments, ratings, and more.
