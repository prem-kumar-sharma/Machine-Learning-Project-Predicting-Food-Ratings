# README for Machine Learning Project Repository

## Project Title: Machine Learning Model Comparison and Evaluation

### Overview
This project focuses on comparing various machine learning models to determine the best-performing one for a given dataset. The models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The primary goal is to identify the model with the highest accuracy for predictive tasks.

### Project Structure

1. **Jupyter Notebook**
   - Contains the entire workflow of the project, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
   - The notebook is available in [21f1000531-notebook-t12024.ipynb](link to 21f1000531-notebook-t12024.ipynb).

### Key Findings

- **Model Accuracy**: Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 77.67%, making it the preferred model for predictions in this project.
- **Comparison of Models**: The project compared five different models, each evaluated on their accuracy to determine the best performer.

### Models Evaluated

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Accuracy: 77.67%

2. **Random Forest**
   - Accuracy: 77.56%

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Accuracy: 73.30%

4. **Naive Bayes**
